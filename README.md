    A version of the popular Battleships game
    One person places ships in a grid
    The other tries to guess or figure out the positions of the ships

    It is a text based version using no external packages and modules
    A focus of this activity is the use of Exceptions
    There are built in exceptions for where there is a runtime error
    e.g. you put the wrong type of value, the index of a list is out of range.
    You can also add your own exceptions 
    In this one it is when you try to place two ships in the same place
    
    Like the game from the previous activity it uses Unicode characters
